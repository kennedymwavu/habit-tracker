## ü§î Problem Statement
I like cancelling stuff off when done. But damn! Ain't I tired of carrying books/diaries with me every place I go?

I want to build better habits for myself be able to cancel each one out once completed, whether daily, weekly or monthly. 

Tried searching online but I can't really find what I want, so I'm gonna build something close to what I want.

## ‚ùì What Do I Want?

Let's the example habit of waking up early (hence sleeping early).

I want it to have it's own calendar, so that when I select that habit I can see how many X's I have (missed days, in red) and blue ticks (NOT WhatsApp's blueticks. Okay, maybe they're the same after all. Visually.)


You see GitHub squares for commits? I want the same but for habits.
