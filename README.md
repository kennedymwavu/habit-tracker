## ü§î Problem Statement
I like cancelling stuff off when done. Yeah this is the real meaning of cancel culture.üíÄ 

But damn! Ain't I tired of carrying books/diaries with me every place I go?

I want to build better habits for myself. Like you know that awakening that hits you suddenly from nowhere and you're just like:

> "I really need to get my shit together!".

And I wanna be able to cancel each habit out once completed, whether daily, weekly or monthly. 

Tried searching online but I can't really find what I have in mind, so I'm gonna build something close to what I want.

## ‚ùì What Do I Want?

Each habit should have it's own calendar, where I can see how many X's I have (missed days, in red) and blue ticks (NOT WhatsApp's blueticks. Okay, maybe they're the same after all. Visually.)


You see GitHub squares for commits? I want the same but for habits.
